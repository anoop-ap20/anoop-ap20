  <summary><h3>Anoop's Technical Journey </h3></summary>
Starting with a Mechanical Engineering background at Vellore Institute of Technology, I developed a strong foundation in 3D modeling (SolidWorks, Autodesk) and data visualization (Power BI, Excel). My interest in data-driven decision-making grew during my In-plant Trainee role at Steel Authority of India Limited, where I got hands-on exposure to industrial processes. Transitioning into business and data analytics, I interned at Clear, leveraging MS Excel, SQL, and automation to support product managers and developers. My contributions led to a full-time role conversion, where I advanced my expertise in VBA Macros, SQL-based dashboards (Metabase), and workflow automation. Now, as a Master’s student in Industrial Engineering at ASU, I continue refining my skills in Python (forecasting & analytics), SQL (DBMS), Power BI, and automation, working on projects like Optimal Portfolio Analysis and Dow Jones Index Forecasting. My journey is a blend of engineering precision, data storytelling, and process optimization, with a passion for turning raw data into actionable insights.
